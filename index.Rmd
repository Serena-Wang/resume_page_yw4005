Hi! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics).

From 2020 to 2022 summer, I was a research fellow working with Prof. Evan Ray and Prof. Nick Reich in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. I was also the lead developer of utility packages that are widely used in projects within the COVID-19 US Forecast Hub and the European Forecast Hub.

In 2020 spring, I earned my BA from [Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu), where I double majored in Computer Science and Statistics. I worked on influenza forcasting with Prof. Evan Ray during my senior year. I am also grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Prof. Leontine Alkema at UMass Amherst, and Prof. Jianbo Lei at Peking Univerisity during my previous summer internships.
